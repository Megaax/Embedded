# Embedded Systems Repository

Welcome to the Embedded Systems repository! This repository contains code and resources related to embedded systems development.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations and drivers for various architectures:

- **AVR**
- **ARM**
- **Tiva C**

## Implemented Drivers

I have implemented both Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) and Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) drivers for the supported microcontrollers. The drivers provide a convenient interface for interacting with the hardware, abstracting away the low-level details.

## Embedded Masterclass

In addition to my educational background, I have successfully completed an intensive Embedded Masterclass. This masterclass covered a wide range of topics, including:

- ARM Cortex-M Architecture
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- Embedded Software Design
- Safe Coding Practices (MISRA)
- Agile Methodologies

Feel free to explore the repository and the implemented drivers. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
